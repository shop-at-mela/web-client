## Overview
This document explains all the SEO changes made to the Mela marketplace, clarifying what affects **SEO ONLY** vs what's **VISIBLE ON PAGE**.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Page Titles (SEO ONLY)
**Files Changed:** `ListingPageCoverPhoto.js`, `ListingPageCarousel.js`

**What Changed:**
- Browser tab titles now use format: `"[Product Name] by [Brand] - Authentic Indian Baby Products | Laem"`
- Example: `"Long Sleeve Kimono Bodysuit by Masilo - Authentic Indian Baby Products | Laem"`

**Impact:**
- ✅ **SEO ONLY**: Affects browser tab title and search engine result titles

### 2. Meta Descriptions (SEO ONLY)
**Files Changed:** `ListingPageCoverPhoto.js`, `ListingPageCarousel.js`

**What Changed:**
- Custom meta descriptions targeting Indian diaspora families
- Example: `"Shop authentic Masilo Long Sleeve Kimono Bodysuit for Indian diaspora families at ₹1,000. Organic cotton, GOTS certified... Trusted Indian baby products delivered to USA."`

**Impact:**

**Impact:**

### 4. Internal Links (VISIBLE ON PAGE)
**Files Changed:** `ListingPageCoverPhoto.js`, `ListingPageCarousel.js`, `ListingPage.module.css`, `en.json`

**What Changed:**
- Added clickable links below product details:
  - "Explore more [Brand Name]" → links to `/brands/brand-slug`
  - "Shop more in [Category]" → links to `/categories/category-slug`

**Impact:**
- ✅ **VISIBLE ON PAGE**: Users see and can click these links
- ✅ **SEO BENEFIT**: Internal linking helps with search engine rankings

   Clickable links that appear on the page
```

### 5. Category & Brand Page Titles (SEO ONLY)
